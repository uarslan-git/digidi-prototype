  - '- Unified version, for all versions of Unity and pipelines.'
  - '    - Automatically installs and updates run time shaders and scripts.'
  - '    - Checks for missing shaders and runtimes.'
  - '- Fixes for:'
  - '    - HDRP shader recompiling.'

  - '## Notes'
  - Version 2.0.0 for all versions of Unity 2020.3 to 6000.0 and all pipelines (HDRP
    / URP / 3D).
  - 
  - To upgrade, remove the old CC/iC Unity Tools entirely and install this with the
    package manager. It should also work if just dropped into Assets.
  - 
  - 'This package will install the shaders, template materials and run-time scripts
    into: **Assets/Reallusion/CCiC Unity Tools**.'
  - 
  - It should also detect when the _wrong_ shader package is installed, or if any
    of the shaders are missing, for the version of Unity and pipeline and present
    options to fix this.
  - 
  - There are also functions to remove and install different shader packages if required.
